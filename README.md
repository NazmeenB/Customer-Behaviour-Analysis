# Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis

## Overview
Welcome! This project walks you through how data can tell a story about customer shopping habits. Using **Python, SQL, and Power BI**, we explore, clean, and analyze data to uncover insights that help make smarter business decisions. Along the way, we create an easy-to-use dashboard and a polished presentation to share what we learn.
## Tools and Technologies
We use a combination of:  
- **Python** for data exploration and cleaning  
- **SQL** (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server) to query data and find trends  
- **Power BI** to build an interactive dashboard for visual storytelling  
- **Gamma** to create a clear, engaging presentation  
- **Jupyter Notebook** as our workspace for coding and analysis

## How We Worked Through It

1. **Loading the Data**  
   We began by loading the dataset into Python to get an initial look—checking columns, types, missing values, and common trends.  

2. **Exploring the Data (EDA)**  
   We dived deeper, summarizing key statistics and visualizing patterns—like which products sell more in different seasons or regions.  

3. **Cleaning Up**  
   We handled missing ratings by filling gaps smartly, renamed columns for clarity, and created helpful features like age groups and purchase frequencies.  

4. **Running SQL Queries**  
   Taking the clean data, we loaded it into popular database systems to run powerful SQL queries that uncovered deeper insights, such as purchase behavior by segment or sales trends over time.  

5. **Building the Dashboard**  
   The Power BI dashboard brings the data to life, letting users play with filters and see visual stories about sales, customers, discounts, and more.

6. **Sharing the Story**  
   Finally, we summed up our findings in a report and designed a sleek presentation in Gamma, making it easy to share business recommendations.

## Dashboard Highlights
Our dashboard helps users quickly understand:  
- What items and categories sell best  
- How customer demographics affect shopping  
- Seasonal and regional trends  
- The impact of discounts and memberships on purchases

## What We Learned
This project helped us identify clear trends that can guide marketing and inventory decisions. More than that, it shows a workflow combining coding, database skills, and visualization to turn raw data into actionable stories.
